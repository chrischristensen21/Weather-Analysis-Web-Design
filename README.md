# Weather Analysis Web Design

## Background

The purpose of this project was to visually display the results of a previously performed weather analysis through a basic user friendly website designed using CSS and bootstrap deployed by GitHub pages: https://chrischristensen21.github.io/index.html

### Website Information

The website consists of 7 total pages:

**A Landing Page** with an explanation of the project and a navigation bar with links to the other 6 pages.
